I have a huge amount of respect for Tony Hsieh. In his book, Delivering Happiness, he explained, very
thoroughly how his company, Zappos, was able to have a very unique, friendly culture and still be a
pretty profitable company, eventually being acquired by Amazon for over $1 billion. I’m very
passionate about being independent, and as an extension of that, very passionate about being an
entrepreneurial type, if not an entrepreneur itself. I’d recommend this book if only for the
writing style.

You may have come across this page as a result of having scrolling problems with a Logitech Trackman
Marble mouse. The straightforward solution to fixing these problems is use of the official software.
For most of you, that’ll do the trick. Just install SetPoint, set a button to activate universal
scroll and you’re all set.

If you want something a bit more robust, I offer this solution:

- Install [X-Mouse Button Control](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm).
- Set a mouse button (I recommend 4 or 5) to “Change Movement to Scroll (Sticky)”, and you’re done.

Additionally, install StrokesPlus to add mouse gestures.

The main difference between using X-Mouse Button Control and SetPoint is that the former
seems to respect scrolling in more scenarios, acting more as an emulation of actual
scrolling. Whereas SetPoint is using something more akin to AutoScroll (if you’re on a
windows machine), which is functional, but can produce strange behavior if you’re on a
virtual machine or in a game.

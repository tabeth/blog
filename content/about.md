What is education? Dictionary.com calls it the “act or process of imparting or
acquiring knowledge.” This world is filled with a countless number of mysteries
that collectively overwhelm our species with curiosity. Like death and taxes,
experiencing education is an inevitable part of the human experience. Perhaps
not in a classroom, or in a lecture hall. Perhaps not in any formal or
traditional matter. Regardless, from your first steps as a child to the
long strides you take as you run as an adult, you have been educated.
By your environment, your peers, your parents and the world.

Personally, I believe the greatest unsolved problem in educational technology
is reading. Reading and writing are humanity’s greatest weapon in communicating
vast swaths of information to one another. Unfortunately, the worldwide literacy
rate is at a paltry 86%, with countries as low as the 30s. This unfortunate
statistic is not something we should just sit down and accept,
but rather we should do work to fix it. Increasing peoples’
reading comprehension with technology, however is incredibly difficult.
Despite this, I am confident that not only can it be done, but it will
be done in the near future. I would argue that improving reading
comprehension is one of the critical problems of the information age.

I’ve said a lot, but who am I? My name is Tabeth Nkangoh, and I’m a software
engineer at an educational technology company whose goal is to help students
engage one another with incredible mentorship experiences. I am also an
aspiring data scientist who wants to take the many mysteries of the
world and make them digestible to people across all backgrounds.
It won’t be an easy task, but that’s ok. Landing on the moon
wasn’t an easy task, either.

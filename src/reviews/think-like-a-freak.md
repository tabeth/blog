If you haven’t heard of Freakonomics before, then I suggest you go check them
out [right now](http://freakonomics.com/). The Freakonomics podcast is one of the highest quality podcasts
available and is generally excellent in terms of pacing, content, and
educational value.

Think Like a Freak is a continuation of Freakonomics, but rather than discuss the
“what”, the book aims to discuss the “why” and the “how” you can see the “hidden
side of everything”, the trademark line of the series. Like most difficult
questions, the book hardly hands the reader any straightforward solutions, but
it does have a series of excellent suggestions with accompanying examples. I’ll
share some of the suggestions I found the most enlightening:

- Smart people think they are smarter than they are

    I think everyone does this at least at some point. Thinking that your domain
    knowledge somehow qualifies you to give people suggestions or advice in domains
    that are outside of your expertise, or that maybe you’re smart enough that you
    might be smarter than a “dumb expert”, so to speak. In the book, Dubner and
    Levitt illustrate how this is not true in practice, but can even have a
    damaging, counter-intuitive effect (see: political pundits making predictions
    about the economy). In general, most people are not as smart as they think they
    are for novel domains.


- It is OK not to know

    Follwing the last point, people are often too hesitant to admit that they don’t know
    anything. A funny example in the book tells of a story of a mega-company
    spending millions in advertising in a small town, only to later realize after a
    mishap of an employee they stopped advertising one week, and that the
    advertising isn’t necessarily even effective. Unfortunately, due to the
    reluctance of admitting that they don’t know the true efficacy the
    advertisements continued leaving it a mystery to whether or not the company’s
    money is being spent wisely.

- Focus on small problems

    There tons of huge problems to think about: global warming, povery, economic inequality, space travel,
    but these problems are large to the point of being intractable. The excellent example given by
    Dubner and Levitt is that one should focus on smaller, more focused problems. By doing so it’s
    easier to identify the root cause of the problem and consequently, you might have a better chance at
    succeeding in solving the problem.

- Quitting can be good.

  I had some things to say about this, but you really should just listen to the
  [segment](http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/30/new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-the-upside-of-quitting/) Freakonomics
  put out on this.

Some other things that were interesting were in regards to incentives:

1. Figure out what people care about, not what they say they care about.
2. Incentivize them on dimensions that are cheap for you but highly valuable to them.
3. Pay attention to how people respond to your incentives.
4. Whenever possible, use incentives that switch from adversarial to cooperative.
5. Never think that people will ever do something just because it’s the right thing to do.
6. Realize that people will always do something to game the system that you  never could have imagined.

There is a lot more to say about this book, but you really should just go and listen to the podcast. A word
of caution, though this is an excellent book, if you have been keeping up with Freakonomics for a
while, I would actually advise you not to read this book, as many of its contents are echoing many
of the things mentioned in the podcast. This isn’t necessarily a fault of the book, but a reality
nonetheless.

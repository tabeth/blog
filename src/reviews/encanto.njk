Jï»¿ust watched Encanto, by Disney. It was a pretty solid movie. I'd say my main criticisms are that it's never explicitly explained why Mirabel doesn't get powers. I've seen theories suggesting that her power is to "bring people together", but it seems like a cop-out, honestly. Otherwise a good movie. 4/5.

Christian Rudder’s Dataclysm gives us an eerie peek at the vast amounts of 
insight possible through the use of OkCupid’s extensive dataset. I won’t 
bother to repeat the disturbing trends, but I will mention some highlights 
from the book itself.

The book, despite how often and thoroughly it piqued my interest, is just full
of disturbing facts and anecdotes. From blind women who reject minorities on the
basis of their hair texture alone, to whiteness adding significantly to your
perceived attractiveness across dating website, the book does little to instill
a sense of fairness in the reader.

This very fact, however, is what the book loosely is about. Though data can be and
is a great help to many disciplines of science, perhaps the greatest asset, and
the greatest weakness of data is its ability to explain. Whether you’re
attempting to explain the ridiculousness of a tweet that ruined a woman’s life
or prove rigorously that beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder, data can
help humanity understand the seemingly infinite mysteries of the universe.

In spite of this, data can also mislead and potentially cause harm. Dataclysm was
an interesting book that was worth reading, but given clear acknowledgement of
the responsibility of stakeholders to protect the use of data and ensure its
integrity, I was disappointed to not read more about that in this book.

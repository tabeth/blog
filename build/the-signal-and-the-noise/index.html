    <p class='f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4'>I just finished reading Nate Silver’s the Signal and the Noise and it makes very interesting points
about forecasting and predictions. In particular, there were two main things that I got out if the
book.</p><hr>
<p class='f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4'>The first is that Big Data won’t solve all of humanity’s problems regarding uncertainty. I’m
certainly a proponent of machine learning and data science, but it was enlightening to see how many
fields are still struggling with making accurate forecasts in spite of the plethora of data
available.</p><p class='f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4'>The second thing I learned about was the existence of Bayes’ Theorem. I took an introductory
statistics class in college, but I guess it wasn’t advanced enough because I had never heard of
this guy. It will be exciting learning more about Bayes and his theorem considering how it
intuitive it was.</p><p class='f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure mb4'>Overall, an excellent book and a great way to get more interested in statistics as well as data
analysis. I think my only criticism would be that Nate discusses the history much more than
actionable steps on how current forecasters can improve their own forecasts. There are parts in the
book where he discusses this, but it’s mainly a tease. However, it’s likely some combination of it
being out of the scope of the book and Nate himself just not having all the answers.</p>
